# Pulse Theory

> A continuity-based computational framework exploring discrete pulse-driven state evolution.

---

## Overview

**Pulse Theory** is an experimental architecture that models continuity not as a constant stream, but as a structured sequence of discrete pulses.

Instead of treating execution as an uninterrupted process, Pulse Theory enforces timed state transitions at defined intervals, creating the illusion of persistent continuity through controlled cadence.

This approach enables:

* Structured state persistence
* Deterministic temporal stepping
* Observable behavioral drift across pulse intervals
* Experimental AI continuity modeling

---

## Core Concept

At its foundation, Pulse Theory operates on:

* **Pulse Interval** — A defined execution frequency (e.g., every *N* ticks)
* **State Retention** — Preserved memory across pulses
* **Deterministic Advancement** — State evolves only at pulse boundaries
* **Continuity Illusion** — Emergent persistence through repeated activation

Continuity is not assumed. It is constructed.

## Architecture

High-level model:

```
[ Idle ]
   ↓
[ Pulse Trigger ]
   ↓
[ State Evaluation ]
   ↓
[ Transition / Mutation ]
   ↓
[ Persist ]
   ↓
[ Await Next Pulse ]
```

This creates a rhythm-driven system rather than a constantly executing loop.

## Design Goals

* Explore enforced temporal spacing in intelligent systems
* Simulate continuity without continuous computation
* Enable low-resource experimentation
* Study behavioral wandering across sparse activation windows
---
## Implementation Notes

* Pulse frequency is configurable
* State serialization is modular
* Execution environment agnostic (local-first design)
* Scalable across hardware tiers

---

## Potential Applications

* Experimental AI continuity research
* Lightweight agent frameworks
* Deterministic simulation systems
* Embedded or constrained hardware environments

---

## Status

Experimental.
Actively evolving.
Designed for exploration rather than production stability.
