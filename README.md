# Pulse Theory

> A continuity-first cognitive architecture exploring pulse-driven state evolution
> — where thought isn’t constant, it *emerges in rhythm*.

Pulse Theory is an **experimental AI framework** that treats cognition like a heartbeat:

* Not constant evaluation
* Not stateless replies
* But **discrete pulses of compute that drive sustained internal state**

This generates continuity not by running endlessly, but by letting sparse, rhythmic evaluation build persistent behavior.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Instead of treating an AI as a black box that responds once per prompt, Pulse Theory:

* Maintains *state across time*
* Schedules internal activity on a heartbeat
* Tracks emotional and curiosity variables
* Generates spontaneous introspections
* Allows for agentic behavior that isn’t just user-driven

The result is *continuity without constant execution* — a model that feels alive between interactions rather than reinitialized every time.

## 🧪 What Makes Pulse Theory Different

Pulse Theory is not:

* A chatbot
* A task-only agent
* A simple wrapper around an LLM

Pulse Theory **models internal life** at a coarse temporal grain, enabling:

* Spontaneous thoughts
* Curiosity drift
* Emotion scaling
* Persistence through idle periods

Rather than forcing continuity with brute-force loops, Pulse Theory lets it *emerge*.

## 📦 Key Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pulse**           | A discrete activation event that triggers internal evaluation |
| **Continuity**      | State that persists between pulses                            |
| **Curiosity**       | An internal drive variable that motivates reflection          |
| **Emotion**         | Valence, arousal, attachment — tracked over time              |
| **DMN**             | Default mode that reflects internal state when idle           |
| **Random Thoughts** | Spontaneous agents of internal drift                          |
